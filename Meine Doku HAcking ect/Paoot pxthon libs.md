    ```
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    # For specific CUDA versions, check https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
    ```
    
     
    
- **Pandas:** A library providing data structures and data analysis tools, particularly useful for working with structured data (like tables or spreadsheets).
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-pandas
    ```
    
     
    
- **Matplotlib:** A 2D plotting library for Python, used to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

- **Seaborn:** A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-seaborn
    ```
    
     
    

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Notebooks:**

- **Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab:** Web-based interactive computing environments that allow you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Highly recommended for experimentation and learning.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    pip install notebook jupyterlab
    # To run Jupyter Notebook:
    jupyter notebook
    # To run JupyterLab:
    jupyter lab
    ```
    
     
    
- **Spyder:** A powerful scientific Python development environment with features like an editor, interactive console, variable explorer, and debugger.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    sudo apt install spyder
    ```
    
     
    
- **VS Code (with Python extension):** A widely used and versatile code editor with excellent Python support through extensions. You can install VS Code from its official website and then install the Python extension within the editor.
- **PyCharm (Community Edition):** A dedicated Python IDE with extensive features for development. The Community Edition is free and suitable for most machine learning tasks. You can download it from the JetBrains website.

**Other Useful Tools:**

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** If you plan to work with natural language processing (NLP), NLTK provides libraries and resources for tasks like text classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-nltk
    # You might also need to download NLTK data:
    python3 -m nltk.downloader all
    ```
    
     
    
- **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** If you're interested in computer vision tasks, OpenCV provides a wide range of functions for image and video processing, object detection, etc.
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-opencv
    ```
    
     
    

**Installation Tips for Parrot OS:**

- **Use `apt` for system-level packages:** For libraries that have Debian packages available (like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, OpenCV, Spyder), using `sudo apt install` is generally recommended as it integrates well with the system's package management.
- **Use `pip` for Python-specific packages:** For libraries that are primarily distributed through PyPI (like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Jupyter), use `pip install`. It's good practice to upgrade `pip` before installing other packages: `pip install --upgrade pip`.
- **Consider Virtual Environments:** To avoid conflicts between different projects and their dependencies, it's highly recommended to use Python virtual environments (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`). You can create an isolated environment for each machine learning project.
- **GPU Support:** If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to accelerate deep learning tasks with TensorFlow or PyTorch, you'll need to install the appropriate NVIDIA drivers, CUDA toolkit, and cuDNN library. Follow the specific installation guides for TensorFlow and PyTorch for GPU support.
